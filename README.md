Oracle
======

The oracle predicts the future!

This is able to create a `java.util.Random` object which duplicates one that
has been generating observed results. An observed result is any decision that
was generated based on the methods of the Random object.

This is currently very incomplete so the following documentation is more of a
statement of intent than a list of current features.
