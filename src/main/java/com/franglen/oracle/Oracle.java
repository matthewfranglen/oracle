/**
 * This predicts the values that java.util.Random objects will produce based on
 * observed values produced by those Random objects.
 *
 * Fundamentally this works because Java Random objects are predictable. They
 * are designed to produce the same output when started with the same seed. The
 * source code for java.util.Random creates randoms like so:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *     public Random() {
 *         this(seedUniquifier() ^ System.nanoTime());
 *     }
 * 
 *     private static long seedUniquifier() {
 *         // L'Ecuyer, "Tables of Linear Congruential Generators of
 *         // Different Sizes and Good Lattice Structure", 1999
 *         for (;;) {
 *             long current = seedUniquifier.get();
 *             long next = current * 181783497276652981L;
 *             if (seedUniquifier.compareAndSet(current, next))
 *                 return next;
 *         }
 *     }
 * 
 *     private static final AtomicLong seedUniquifier
 *         = new AtomicLong(8682522807148012L);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The important thing here is that:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The current time forms part of the initial seed.</li>
 * <li>This is combined with a series of values based on the constants
 * 8682522807148012L and 181783497276652981L</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Only a small number of Random objects are usually created to drive a program,
 * and they are usually created near the start of the program. This means that
 * the seed uniquifier and time can be deduced to generate all possible seeds.
 * 
 * These possible seeds can then be filtered using known constraints. The known
 * constraints are calls to the target Random object which have observed
 * results.
 *
 * These constraints are based on knowledge of the source code, so given the
 * code:
 *
 * <pre>
 * </code>
 *     public int getSomeValue() {
 *         return random.nextInt() % 4;
 *     }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then any seed which does not produce 32 initial bits which match the observed
 * modulo result cannot be the starting seed. In this example that would reduce
 * the space of valid seeds by 3/4. Given that each known value can reduce the
 * space by a factor it should only take a few to narrow down to the single
 * starting seed.
