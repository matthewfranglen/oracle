/**
 * This predicts the values that java.util.Random objects will produce.
 * 
 * The Oracle can predict the future. Lucky for it, Random objects are predictable.
 *
 * The source code for java.util.Random creates randoms like so:
 *
    public Random() {
        this(seedUniquifier() ^ System.nanoTime());
    }

    private static long seedUniquifier() {
        // L'Ecuyer, "Tables of Linear Congruential Generators of
        // Different Sizes and Good Lattice Structure", 1999
        for (;;) {
            long current = seedUniquifier.get();
            long next = current * 181783497276652981L;
            if (seedUniquifier.compareAndSet(current, next))
                return next;
        }
    }

    private static final AtomicLong seedUniquifier
        = new AtomicLong(8682522807148012L);
 *
 * The important thing here is that:
 * 1) The current time forms part of the initial seed.
 * 2) This is combined with a series of values based on the constants 8682522807148012L and 181783497276652981L
 *
 * Only a small number of Random objects are created in this project, and most
 * of them will be created within the first second that the program runs. It
 * should be possible to deduce the starting seed for each Random object of
 * interest based on constraints that observed values must pass.
 *
 * These constraints are based on knowledge of the source code, so given the code:
 *
    public int getSomeValue() {
        return random.nextInt() % 4;
    }
 *
 * Then any seed which does not produce 32 initial bits which match the
 * observed modulo result cannot be the starting seed. In this example that
 * would reduce the space of valid seeds by 3/4. Given that each known value
 * can reduce the space by a factor it should only take a few to narrow down to
 * the single starting seed.
